[rank0]:[W116 21:27:15.849317527 ProcessGroupNCCL.cpp:4561] [PG ID 0 PG GUID 0 Rank 0]  using GPU 0 to perform barrier as devices used by this process are currently unknown. This can potentially cause a hang if this rank to GPU mapping is incorrect. Specify device_ids in barrier() to force use of a particular device, or call init_process_group() with a device_id.
